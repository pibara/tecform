INTRODUCTION
------------

Stalker's SMTP Mailer is a simple mail sender (not receiver) to use
from command prompt. It was written for use in conjunction with CGI
scripts. It has a command line syntax similar to BSD UNIX and then
minor changes will be needed to port UNIX scripts on NT.
 
Stalker's SMTP mailer is MIME compliant (useful for countries other
than US!). It allows file attachments.

As a 32bits app, it requires Microsoft Windows NT or (at least)
Windows 95. Microsoft's TCP/IP stack must be up and running.



INSTALLATION
------------

Put mail.exe in any directory, and mail.ini in the Windows directory.
Program location can be appended to the PATH environment variable in
order to run mail.exe from other directories.
The app creates temporary files for attachments, so it's better to have
a TEMP or TMP environment variable.
An optional environment variable can be added to override the search of
mail.ini in Windows directory and the writing of output files in the
current one:

SET SM=C:\WIN32APP\MAIL
  
This allows a multiusers configuration:

SET SM=C:\USERS\%USERNAME%\MAIL

To find mail.ini, Mail.exe first checks if there is a SET variable,
afterwhat it checks current directory, and finally it checks Windows
directory.
  
Note:
If your httpd runs as SYSTEM user (and not as a custom pseudo-user),
in order to run the app within a CGI, the environment variables
must be "system" (not "user") ones, and must be set from:
"Control Panel" > "System" > "System environment variables".
BTW: Don't forget to reboot!


SYNTAX
------

mail [-s subject] [-f body] [-c cc-addr] [-b bcc-addr] [-a attach-list] to-addr...

-s subject
Specifie subject on command line (only the first argument after
the -s flag will be used as a subject; be careful to quote ("...")
subjects containing spaces.)

-f body
Specifie a text file to use as mail body.

-c cc-addr
Send Carbon-copies (Cc:) to a comma-separated list of recipients.

-b bcc-addr
Send Blind-carbon-copies (Bcc:) to a comma-separated list of recipients.

-a attach-list
Attach a comma-separated list of files.

to-addr
Send mail (To:) to a list of recipents. Must be at the end of command
line, and at least one is needed.

You can specifie up to 100 recipients at all.
You can attach up to 100 files.


RETURN VALUES
-------------
On exit, mail.exe returns several values which can be used within scripts
calling the program. They are:

0	:Success exit
1	:Invalid parameters error
2	:Invalid mail.ini error
3	:TCP/IP error
4	:SMTP error
5	:Mail not sent (bad recipients)
6	:Mail partially sent (some bad recipients)
7	:Program failure


SENDING MAIL
------------

To send a message to one or more people, mail can be invoked with
arguments which are the names of people to whom the mail will be send.
Yo are then expected to type in your message followed by an <ctrl-Z>.

Some command lines examples are:

mail -s "My subject" -c riri@stalkerlab.ch,fifi@stalkerlab.ch loulou@stalkerlab.ch
(two Cc: recipients plus one To: recipient)

mail -s "My subject" -c riri@stalkerlab.ch fifi@stalkerlab.ch loulou@stalkerlab.ch
(one Cc: recipients plus two To: recipients)

mail -s "My subject" -c riri@stalkerlab.ch -b fifi@stalkerlab.ch loulou@stalkerlab.ch
(one Cc: recipient, plus one Bcc: recipient plus one To: recipient)

mail -s "Your files..." -a c:\autoexec.bat,"c:\long name\image.gif" riri@stalkerlab.ch
(send two files, one is quoted because it has long name with space)


Instead of manually enter your mail body, you can do pipes or files
redirections, this is useful for CGIs:

mail -s "My subject" voisard@dial.eunet.ch < body.txt > process.log
(will use the file body.txt as mail body, and will verbose the process
to a log file)

echo BodyBuffer ¦ mail -s "My subject" voisard@dial.eunet.ch > process.log
(will take the output of echo as mail body, and will verbose the
process to a log file)

mail -s "My subject" -f body.txt voisard@dial.eunet.ch > process.log
(will use the file body.txt as mail body, and will verbose the process
to a log file)

There is no limit with body size, but each line can't be longer than
1000 chars and MUST be ended with CR/LF (Carriage-Return and Line-Feed).
Note that UNIX style (LF alone) will work, but Macintosh type (CR
alone) will not.



ERRORS
------

The output of mail verboses all the sending process. 
If the mail message was present before an error occured, or if the
mail was not or partially sent for any reason, it is appended to the
file dead.letter.txt. So it is possible to handle it manually as a last
resort.



Mail.ini
--------

Some setting must be specified in the mail.ini:

Gateway=
Name of the SMTP relay

Sender=
Email address of the sender which will appear in the "From:" field of
the mail header. 

Realname=
Real name of the sender which will also appear in the "From:" field of
the mail header.

Textencode=
This is a MIME encoding parameter. Stalker's Mailer uses MIME specs
declarations and encoding.
If Textencode=no, mail will be sent 8bits MIME to the mail relay without
encoding.
If Textencode=yes, mail will be sent 7bits Quoted-printable MIME encoded.
This setting depends on the mail relay capabilities to handle 8bits
chars, but it is more reliable to force 7bits encoding.

AttachInline=
Some mail readers allow to append attachments like images or HTML on the
message. This setting specifies if attachments must be handled as
separate files, or if they can be showed in line, within the message. 

Charset=
Specifies the local charset used (e.g. US = us-ascii; Latin = iso-8859-1)


The [MIME Types] section specifies some well known MIME types, based
on files extensions. When mail.exe doesn't find any matchs with
the file to be attached, it uses application/octet-stream as default.
Adding new MIME types is allowed, but be sure to add corrects MIME types.
If you plan to use some private types for internal use, you must append
the prefix "X-" to your type, i.e:

yours=application/X-yours

So files with .yours as extension can be handled as you want by some mail
readers understanding X-yours.
