So you are cursed with NT or Win95 for your WWW server, that not verry nice.
TECForM basicaly is a program written for Unix, this is the first atempt in
making it work with NT/95. There is no guaranty that this TECForM release 
will actualy work with NT/95, but you are welcome to give it a try.
There is no setup script available for NT/95 so if anyone would like to
make one available that would be great, if you do please mail it to
rmeijer@xs4all.nl. 

First you need to have a WWW server runing  and that webserver needs to 
ba able to run perl CGI scripts for TECForM is such a script.

NT does not have sendmail, a simple program to send mails, TECForM uses 
sendmail, so on NT/95 first you have to install mail.exe from this dir
(This is a third party program 'Stalkers Mail.exe') so TECForM has access
to a somewhat sendmail compliant mailer.

Next you need to make the perl file complete, in this dir you will find
a file called tecform.hdr with some variables defined, change these to
your situation, and than take this file and the tecform.raw file in ..\SRC
and murge them into a 'tecform.pl' file, than put this file in your
cgi-bin directory.

The last thing you need to do is making the 'data' directory and al its files
owned by the user you are running your www server as.

Now all you need to do is coppy the 'www' the documentroot of your www 
server, and rename the dir to 'tecform'. 

That about sums it up, i wish you verry much luck in installing TECForM 
on NT/95.
