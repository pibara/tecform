Template Extended CGI Form Mailer (TECForM) 2.0

Tecform 2.0 is a shadowware CGI script that allows the mailing of a 
completely template specified fully Mime complient mail truegh an HTML 
mailform.

It lets you specify within the mail form (in so called hidden fields) 
a template in which different fields of the form are filled in.
This way the output format of the mail can be exactly specified.

Next to this Tecform allows you to specify within the form which fields 
of the form are manditory an which are not. So you will not recieve a 
mail if the form is not completely filled in with all the information 
that you need. It also allows you to set regular expressions for fields,
and specifiing error messages or documents when the regular expressions 
or the required fields are not satisfied.

The shadowware status of TECForm means that you can use TECForm for free
on your server, for both commercial and non commercial purposes, but that 
you are obliged to shadow the TECForm distibution on your site.
Although over many people have downloaded and installed the previous 
version of TECForm, noone seemed willing to honnor my request to shadow
TECForm. For this reason in order to use this version of TECForm, i must
be more explicit, if you don't shadow TECForm, you can't use TECForm.
