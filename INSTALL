Note, tecform is a cgi program written in perl, and makes use of the 
sendmail program, in order to properly install TECForM you need to have
the following programs installed:

* perl (both perl4 and perl5 will do)
* sendmail, or a equivalent to sendmail
* a httpd with cgi capabilities

If you are running NT or win95 instalation 'should' also be posible but a 
litle more difficult than with Unix. Look in the NT directory for 
instructions.

There are two ways to install tecform under Unix. 

If you are a single user who has a private cgi-bin dir, you don't need to 
run the tecform administrator of the TECForM package.
You can skip to section 2 of this document.

1) Full install Configuration of tecform.
If you want to run a full install of tecform including the tecform
administrator part (if you plan to use tecform for more than one adress
you do want this) the next part is needed.

Before installing tecform you need to check out a couple of things about
the http server on your system, the setup script will try to determine 
them for you, but its better if you look then up yourself first to be sure:

* the UID the httpd is running as.
* the url you can put the TECForM html files.

In order to install this script you must do the following:

* su root
* place tecform_xxx.tar into your /usr/local dir and untar it:
  tar xf tecform_xxx.tar
* change dir to the source dir of tecform:
  cd /usr/local/tecform/src/ 
* run the setup program:
  ./setup.pl
  setup wil try to determine the location of a few progams, and ask you a few
  questions, that you should be able to awnser.

2) Single user Configuration of tecform

If you are installing tecform for a single user (the user you are logged 
in as) installing tecform will be much easyer for you:

* place tecform_xxx.tar into your personal root dir and untar it:
  tar xf tecform_xxx.tar
* change dir to the source dir of tecform:
  cd tecform/src/
* run the setup program with the single user switch:
  ./setup.pl -s
  setup wil try to determine the location of a few progams, and ask you a few
  questions, that you should be able to awnser.

3) Instalation
* copy everything in tecform/cgi-bin/ file to your cgi directory.
* make a 'tecform' dir in your www dir, and put everything from the in 
  tecform/www/ directory in this directory

4) Admin setup

If you have done a full setup, now you can call the admin function with
your www browser with something like:

http://your.host.name/cgi-bin/tecform.pl/admin/
