<H2>CAPIBARA</H2>
As soon as TECForM 2.1 is ready i will start working on a product closely 
related to TECForM.<br><br> 

<b>The following programs will be released as one product named capibara.</b><br>
Capibara together with TECForM will give you a real and interactive interface between the web and your
database, it will however not do more than providing you with interfaces, so you could still do all your database
manipulations with your favourite database program.<br>
Capibara will concist of four programs written to work under windows.
<H3>Capibara Popsplitter</H3>
Capibara Popsplitter will be a Windows
POP extention to TECForM, that should do the job of the gateway script
included in the 2.0 version of TECForM, for the users with a dail in
internet account.<BR>
Popsplitter will be a a program that houses between your mail program and
the POP server of your ISP, so when you tell your mail program to get your
mail from your local popserver (Popsplitter) Popsplitter will act as a 
local gateway to your ISP's POP server, giving all the regular mail to
the mail program and filtering out all special TECForM generated mail,
and saving this for offline processing.<BR>
After the connection is closed, popsplitter can than activate all kinds of
programs (user configurable) to process the data send by TECForM.<BR>
<H3>Capibara TECBase</H3>
One program that will be verry usefull for use with Popsplitter in combination with TECForM will be
TECBase, TECBase moves the templates to the client side, and exept for templates that generate files,
TECBase also allows for Templates that put the information that is submitted from the web directly into your
local database. Together with TECForm and Popsplitter TECBase forms a distributed WWW to Database gateway.
<H3>Capibara Publish</H3>
Publish will complete the circle that started with TECForM, this program will make it posible to generate
WWW pages from your database using templates. It will automaticaly keep a list of changed pages, so that if
you don't change the templates, only the changed reccords will be marked for updating. 
<H3>Capibara update</H3>
Update will be a simple FTP program that is linkable to Publish, it will take the marked files generated by
Publish and automaticaly upload them to your website.
