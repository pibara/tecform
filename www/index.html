<p>
Tecform 2.0 is a CGI script that allows the mailing of a 
completely template specified Mime compliant mail through an HTML mailform.
<p>
It lets you specify within the mail form (in so called hidden fields) 
a template in which different fields of the form are filled in.
This way the output format of the mail can be exactly specified.
<p>
</b> Tecform allows you to specify within the form which fields 
of the form are manditory an which are not. So you will not recieve a 
mail if the form is not completely filled in with all the information 
that you need.It also has the posibility of specifiing regular 
expressions for fields, and setting error messages or documents that are 
called when a regular expression or a manditory field is not OK
<p>
If you ar running a WWW site you will notice that a lot of questions can
be awnsered by TECForM, you will find out that TECForM will awnser most of your
mailing needs. TECForM can save you hundreds of programming hours on different
CGI scripts that need to output mail, with TECForM you can configure this one
CGI script to meet your wishes from within the form that is used to call the
script. This makes TECForM certanly one of the most flexible mail cgi scripts
arround, and what is better you get it free.
