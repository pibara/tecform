                      Sending mail using TECBase

             The example in the file EXAMPLE shows you how to do a simple 
             formatted e-mail, you can use this for manny things but sometimes 
             you would like the information that is filled in to be submitted 
             to some kind of database, so that you can process it with a
             database program, permitting you to process the data in a more
             profesional way. This is where TECBase comes in, TECBase is
             a client side template program, that enables you to put the
             information send directly into a database, witch you can than
             process with your database programs, after what you can use
             an other feature of TECBase to turn your database into web
             pages that you can than put back on the internet.
             To use TECBase you must replace the mltemplate field in
             your form by a line like this:

            <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="mltecbase" VALUE="test1">

            This wil tell TECForm to use a special form of mail formatting
            that TECBase uses to see and process mails it has to process,
            and that TECBase should use the client side database template called
            test1.

            At the moment of this release of TECForM 2.0 (Feb 97) TECBase
            was still in the alpha stage, you can find more info on TECBase
