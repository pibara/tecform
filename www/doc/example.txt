                              A simple example 



              The tecform script is a cgi mailscript. The script enables users
              of a server to be send an e-mail truegh an html page, in anny
              form they wish. They could even use it to send themselves
              html pages, or pieces of html that they could use to make new pages
              quickly. 
              
              The script is a cgi script and is called from an html page.
              For this a form is used inside the html page.

              The basic  html-code for the form is:
              <FORM ACTION="/cgi-bin/tecform.pl" METHOD="POST">
              <INPUT TYPE="submit">
              </FORM>

              Inside this basic code you have to fill in a couple of
              fields that the script needs: 
                  - The fields the user could fill in
                  - The login name of the user that will recieve the mail
                  - The e-mail adress of the sender
                  - The subject of the mail
                  - A template for the e-mail
                  - The name of the page that should be caled when a user
                    fails to fill in all the fields that are required.
                  - The name of the page that should be called when the mail
                    has been send ok.
                  - The required fields



              We shal show all these fiellds and the posibilities of TECForM
              using an example.
  


              <FORM ACTION="/cgi-bin/tecform.pl" METHOD="POST">
              <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="mlto" VALUE="="rmeijer">

              <TEXTAREA NAME="veld3" ROWS=24 COLS=75></TEXTAREA>
              <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="mlneeded" VALUE="veld2,veld3">
              <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="mltemplate" VALUE=
              "Email:@{veld1}@ 
              Naam:@{veld2}@ 
              Remarks:@{veld3}@">
              <INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Verzenden">
              </FORM>

              Dit form makes it posible to send an e-mail to the lokal user 'rmeijer'
              
              The following line links the html input fields to the script:
              <FORM ACTION="/cgi-bin/tecform.pl" METHOD="POST">

              <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="mlto" VALUE="="rmeijer">
              This line tels the script to send the mail to the local user
              (on the http server) 'rmeijer'.

              <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="mlheader_from
              VALUE="mailform@invalid.domain">
              This line sets the sender of the mail to the obvious invalid e-mail
              adress mailform@invalid.domain, this will remind you that the sender
              would not have to be who he sais he is.

              <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="mlheader_subject"
              VALUE="This is just a test subjectline">
              This line sets the subject of the mail that is send to
              'This is just a test subjectline'.
   
              <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="mlerrurl"
              VALUE="/~rmeijer/error.html">
              This line tels the script what file should be send if it turns
              out that not all required fields are filled in.
              This line specifies a so called error document.

              <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="mlokurl"
              VALUE="/~rmeijer/index.html">
              This line tels the script what file should be send if the user has filled 
              in all fields that he should have.

              <INPUT TYPE="text" SIZE=50 NAME="veld1">
              This line specifies a userdefined input field, with the name 'veld1'

  
              It is posible to make the field just specified manditory,
              this is done using the following line:
              <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="mlneeded" VALUE="veld1">
              This line makes it so that if the field with the name 'veld1'
              is not filled in, the error document is send.

              <INPUT TYPE="text" SIZE=50 NAME="veld2">
              <TEXTAREA NAME="veld3" ROWS=24 COLS=75></TEXTAREA>
              These lines specifies two userdefined input fields with the names 'veld2'
              and 'veld3'.

              <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="mlneeded" VALUE="veld2,veld3">
              This line specifies to the script that it is manditory for the user
              to fill in at least one of the input fields 'veld2' and 'veld3'.

              <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="mltemplate" VALUE=
              "Email:@{veld1}@ 
              Naam:@{veld2}@ 
              Opmerking:@{veld3}@">

              This line is the most important line of the form, it specifies to the
              script what form the mail that is send has.
              What it in fact does is specify a template for the mail, in what different
              input fields can be filled in.
              @{veld1}@ specifies that on that place the value the user fils in for
              'veld1'. 

              When making the template field there are three important points to
              look at.

              1.The contents of an input field can be substituded into the mail
                by placing the name of the field between @{ and }@ like this:
                @{veld1}@

              2. Characters that have a special meaning in html can not directly be
                 used in the template. The way to get arount this is by specifying
                 these characters in hexadecimal notation preceded by a '%'
                 for example %0A will be replaced in the mail by a RETURN.
                 Here follows a short list of important characters.
  
                  < = %3C 
                  > = %3E 
                  & = %26 
                  " = %22 
                  ; = %3B 

              3. If you wish to use the % character, you can do this as follows:
                  @{%}@


              There are also some special variables you can place in the template:
               @{HTTP_USER_AGENT}    is replaced by the name of the browser the user sender
               @{REMOTE_ADDR}        is replaced by the IP adres of the machine of the sender
               @{REMOTE_HOST}        is replaced by the name of the machine of the sender.

          
              <INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Verzenden">
              This line creates a button the user can use to start the script.

              </FORM>
              This line ends the form.
