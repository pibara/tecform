TECForM now is completely Mime compliant.
You can to every detail specify a Mime message, even multipart messages 
are posible. You could for example send info both in plain text, and in html
formating within the same mail, and many other combinations are posible.

First you can specify the encoding of the bodyparts, default 8bit is now 
used, but with the variable 'mlencoding' you can set the encoding to
'binary','7bit','quoted-printable'or even 'base64' encoding.

There now can be multiple templates, if you specify 'mlmultipart' as either
'mixed','alternative', or 'paralel' TECForM will make a multipart mime 
message.

The template(s) can now also have an optional mime type, default is 
'text/plain' but by ading a mime type to the specification of mltemplate,
you can change this, you could for example use a variable called:
'mltemplate_text/html' as your template to set the mimetype of your 
template to   text/html.
