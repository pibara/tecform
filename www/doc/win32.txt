TECForM on NT and 95

Although TECForM was written for unix platforms, and it is now only 
running on unix systems to my knowladge, there should be no 
reason why it could not work on NT or windows 95, as long as there is
a good working version of both a sendmail like program and of a perl
interpreter available.

TECForM now comes with some stuff that should help you on your way in 
seting up TECForM on a NT or 95 machine, however i must note that running
a webserver on NT or 95 is basicaly not a very good thing, if you need
to run a www server on a PC you should concider using Linux and Apache,
both are freely available from the net, and together they outperform
NT, especialy with a higher load. Also concideringsecurity holes in many
webserver running on NT should make you think of choosing Linux.
