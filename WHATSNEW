TECForM 2.0
  *  Added Mime compliancy 
     Tecform does now generate completely Mime compliant mesages with
     completely configurable mime types, it supports all the mime encoding
     types (7bit,8bit,binart,quoted-printable and base64), you can even
     make use of multiple templates and make a multipart mime message with
     a different mime type for each part.
  *  Added regular expressions to TECForm enabling you to set a regular
     expression to what a field should match. This way you can completely 
     specify what the content of a field should be, so the submitter of the 
     form will not be able to fill in rubish
  *  Added 'debug' function, to make it easyer to debug a mailform.
     by turning on the debug switch you can find out whats wrong with
     your regex definitions or mlneeded fields.
  *  Added multiple (numbered) erordocuments, and errortexts, you can now
     split up invalid input into (a maximum of 99) different errordocuments, 
     to make it more clear to the submitter what he did wrong. 
     For fast form generation you can now also use a simple errortext 
     instead of a error document.
  *  Added cgi admin for tecform, to make the new features easy to 
     administer. It is now posible to do some administrative tasks
     on tecform truegh the use of your browser.
  *  Added administrable userbase, to make comercial exploitation of tecform
     easier. You can now from the admin function specify either a list of
     valid e-mail adresses, or regular expressions for e-mail adresses
     to completely controll who could be mailed to using TECForM.
     This makes it more easy to exploit TECForM comercialy.
  *  Added administrable referer base. Just like with the userbase you
     can now also truegh the admin function restrict the place a TECForM
     html form could be submitted from.
  *  Added the posibility to send 'local' adresses to the local mailserver
     instead of the local machine. With the former versions of TECForM you
     were able to restrict the use of TECForM to local users only, what
     in fact only is usefull if the www server is the same machine mail
     is on, what is not always the case, this problem is now fixed.
  *  Added the posibility to send e-mail in TECBase formatting, allowing the
     e-mail to be processed by client side TECBase complient database
     template programs.
  *  Made a workaround for a bug in MSIE, that seems to send %0D where it
     should send %0A, this workaround will only work untill Microsoft
     fixes this problem, if they do please inform me (rmeijer@xs4all.nl),
     that will mean i will have to adapt the workaround a bit.
  *  Added checking of sendmail return values, i know i should have done that
     from the start, but i gues i am human to.
  *  Added shadow function into tecform, to make shadowing more easy, 
     remember, tecform is 'shadowware' now.
  *  Made 'ENVIROMENT' substitution configurable. Some people seem to find
     it scary to have users fetch their httpd's enviroment variables,
     for that reason the enviroment stuff can now be switched off using 
     the admin function.
  *  'Received:' line, telling what IP the form was submitted from/
  *  Improved setup script.
  *  NT dir, you have now a reasonable change getting TECForM installed 
     on NT/95
  *  Added some more examples of TECForm html forms. 
  *  Posibility of simple singleuser install
  *  Response Header file.

TECForM 1.0.3
  *  The status of tecform has changed, tecform is now free of charge
     under the condition that it is mirrored on your site.

TECForM 1.0.2
   *  Removed a litle bug in the @{}@ mechanism
   *  Removed a bug that made the script only work with apache & netscape,
      but that did let it die misarably on an netscape server.
   *  Removed the part that would send a message to the author,
      it seemed to give some troubles for some people.
   *  Removed majure security leak, i am not going to tell you what the
      leak whas, but i must urge you to "UPGRADE NOW !!"
   *  Added the setup script to make it even more easy to install TECForM

TECForM 1.0.1
   *  Added enviroment variables to template, you can now use an cgi
      enviroment variable in your mail template.
      Interesting env variables could be:
      REMOTE_HOST
      REMOTE_ADDR
      HTTP_USER_AGENT
   *  Removed a litle bug, that made the mail end at the point of an 
      \n\r.\n\r
